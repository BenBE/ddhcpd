A Distributed DHCP Daemon
=========================

    ./ddhcp [-i <server_interface>]

Testing
-------

The network-test script can create a setup of virtual interfaces
which is composed of a <number> of server and client interface pairs.
Which are called srvX and cltX in the main network namespace and server0
and client0 in the ''daemon'' network namespace. All srvX are bridged
via br-srv, so the daemons can talk to each other.

Inside the daemon network ns the client0 interface has the address 10.0.0.1/20
, a ipv4 address is needed on this interface so the dhcp part of ddhcp is able
to bind on this interface. There no need for an ipv4 address on the server0 
interface because, we use ipv6 multicast and link local addresses for d2d communication.

You can setup a basic ddhcp network testing enviroment by calling

    # ./network-test net-init <number>

to create a virtual network for <number> of ddhcp instances. You
will need to have priviledges to create network namespaces. Short
use sudo and check the network-test script upfront.

To start the (n-1)-th instance of ddhcp in your test environment
use for example:

    # ./network-test srv-start <n> ./ddhcp 

After starting multiple instances you can make dhcp request
against specific instances of ddhcp by starting dhcp clients pointed
to the cltX interfaces. For example by 

    # dhclient -sf /dev/null -d -v clt0

for the first ddhcp instance.

To deconfigure the setup you can call.

    # ./network-test net-stop
